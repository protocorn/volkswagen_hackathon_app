# V2V Communication via Cloud for Passenger Safety

Welcome to our project, focused on enhancing passenger safety through Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication via the cloud. In today's dynamic world of transportation, safety and security remain paramount concerns. To address these challenges, we've developed a comprehensive solution leveraging V2V communication and cloud technology to create a safer and more secure environment for passengers and road users.

## Key Use Cases
### 1. Real-time Weather Alerts
Our system empowers vehicles to share real-time weather alerts with one another, thereby enabling drivers to adapt to adverse weather conditions such as fog or heavy snowfall. This use case integrates visibility sensors, like LIDAR, to detect weather conditions. When the sensors identify adverse weather, the vehicle promptly communicates this information to nearby vehicles within its V2V communication range. If no vehicles are within the range, the vehicle marks the area as a fog or snowfall zone and sends periodic updates to the cloud. These marks persist until another vehicle confirms normal conditions by passing through the area.

### 2. Anti-Theft Alerts
In the unfortunate event of a car theft, our solution enables car owners to mark their vehicle as stolen via a dedicated app. The data is then transmitted to the cloud, which relays the alert to the stolen car through V2V communication. Simultaneously, nearby vehicles are alerted that they are in proximity to a stolen vehicle. Additionally, the location of the stolen car is shared with law enforcement, allowing for swift action and recovery.

### 3. Collision Avoidance System
Our system enhances road safety by preventing potential collisions. In scenarios where a car abruptly applies emergency braking, the vehicle immediately sends a signal to nearby vehicles through V2V communication, alerting them to the sudden stop. This allows the following cars to apply their brakes promptly, avoiding accidents and enhancing overall road safety.

## How It Works
Our system operates on a foundation of V2V communication, enabling vehicles to establish a real-time network of information exchange. By integrating visibility sensors for weather detection, cloud-based data management, and swift communication between vehicles, we provide an interconnected ecosystem that empowers drivers with critical information to ensure safe and secure transportation.

With these use cases and features, we aim to revolutionize passenger safety and transform the way vehicles interact and communicate on the road. Join us in making our roadways safer for everyone.
